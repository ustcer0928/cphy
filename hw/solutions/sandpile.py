    An Abelian sandpile model simulation. The sandpile is initialized with a random
    number of grains at each lattice site. Then, a single grain is dropped at a random
    location. The sandpile is then allowed to evolve until it is stable. This process
    is repeated n_step times.

    n (int): The size of the grid
    grid (np.ndarray): The grid of the sandpile

        Perform a single step of the sandpile model. Recall that there are two

        A single step of the simulation consists of two stages: a random sand grain is 
        dropped onto the lattice at a random location. Then, a set of avalanches occurs
        causing sandgrains to get redistributed to their neighboring locations.
